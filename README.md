Com base na análise completa dos seus arquivos (especialmente o `site.ts` e o código do seu site em Astro) e no seu novo posicionamento como **Senior Prompt Engineer**, reescrevi seu portfólio.

Fiz uma **fusão estratégica**: mantive a autoridade de SEO (que é um diferencial enorme para IA) mas coloquei o foco principal em **Agentes de IA, Engenharia Reversa e Vibe Coding**.

Aqui está a versão atualizada e otimizada para GitHub `README.md` ou para a página "Sobre" do seu site:

# 🚀 Senior Prompt Engineer & AI Agent Developer

Hi there! 👋 I’m **Jacques Belmont**. I bridge the gap between human intent and machine execution.

Formerly a high-performance Digital Marketing Strategist, I have pivoted to become a **Senior AI Engineer** specializing in **Reverse Prompt Engineering** and **Autonomous Agents**. I don't just write prompts; I architect the logic, context, and workflows that allow Large Language Models (LLMs) to function as reliable employees.

My approach combines **Vibe Coding** (AI-assisted programming) with robust software architecture to build tools that scale.

## 🧠 Core Competencies (The AI Pivot)

### 🛠 **AI Engineering & Vibe Coding**

I treat "English as a Programming Language". My workflow involves:

* **Reverse Context Engineering:** Creating "Artifacts" (documents, schemas, logic) before generating code to prevent AI hallucinations.
* **Vibe Coding:** Building complex full-stack apps (Astro, React, Python) by orchestrating LLMs like Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
* **Agentic Workflows:** Designing autonomous loops using **n8n** and **Python** where AI plans, executes, and reviews its own work.

### 🔍 **SEO & AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)**

Transitioning from traditional SEO to optimizing for AI Search (Perplexity, ChatGPT Search, Gemini):

* **Structured Data (JSON-LD):** helping IAs understand "Entities" over keywords.
* **Semantic SEO:** Writing for LLM context windows, not just Google crawlers.

## 📈 My Philosophy: "The Death of the Simple Prompt"

I believe that typing a single sentence into ChatGPT is amateur. Real results come from **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** reasoning and **Multi-Shot Prompting**.

> *"I don't guess the prompt. I engineer the context so the outcome is inevitable."*
