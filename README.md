## 🌟 What Makes Me Different

I don't just follow tutorials—I build production systems. My background in digital marketing gives me a unique perspective: I understand business metrics, user behavior, and the ROI of automation.

**My approach:**
1. **Start with the problem**, not the technology
2. **Build incrementally** with working prototypes
3. **Document everything** for team knowledge sharing
4. **Focus on maintainability** over clever code
